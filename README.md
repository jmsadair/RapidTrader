# RapidTrader

RapidTrader is a low-latency, high-throughput [order matching system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_matching_system) that is optimised for high frequency trading. This system is capable of processing upwards of 2-4 million order insertions per second and offers support for the following order types:
- Limit
- Market
- Stop
- Trailing Stop

Be aware that this project is still in development - bugs are expected and pull requests are welcome.

## Requirements
- Linux or MacOS
- gcc or clang
- [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [boost](https://github.com/boostorg/boost)

Note that this project may be able to run on other platforms or compilers, but only the ones listed above have been tested at this point. 

## Building
To build and test the project, run the following commands: 
```
  mkdir build && cd build

  cmake ..

  make -j

  make test
```

## Performance
The following are benchmarks of the synchronous and concurrent implementations of RapidTrader. This benchmark measured the performance of the add order operation with a varying number of symbols and orders with a maximum price depth of 15. All benchmarks were ran on an Intel Core i7-8700 processor, which supports up to 12 threads.

As demonstrated by the above data, the synchronous version of RapidTrader tends to offer better performance than the concurrent version until the number of symbols reaches 2000. Profiling has revealed that this is primarily due the synchronisation of memory allocations. A memory pool will likely need to be implemented for the concurrent version in order to eliminate this synchronization.
