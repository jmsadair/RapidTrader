 * Supported order types.
 *
 * Limit: an order type that will only buy / sell a security
 * at a specified price or better. For a limit order
 * on the bid side, the order will only be executed
 * at the price of the order or lower. For a limit
 * order on the ask side, the order will only execute
 * at the price of the order or higher.
 *
 * Market: an order type that will buy / sell a security
 * at the best available price. This type of order
 * will be executed immediately, but the price at
 * which the order is executed is not guaranteed.
 * If the there is not enough volume to completely
 * fill the order, it will be filled as much as possible
 * before being deleted.
 *
 * Stop: an order type that will buy / sell a security once the price
 * of the security reaches the stop price. When the stop price
 * is reached, the order becomes a market order.
 *
 * Stop Limit: an order type that will buy / sell a security once the
 * price of the security reaches the stop price. When the stop price
 * is reached, the order becomes a limit order.
 *
 * Trailing Stop: a stop order that does not have a specific stop price.
 * Instead, the stop price is defined as a specific dollar amount (the trail
 * amount) below or above the market price of the security (the trailing stop price).
 *
 * Trailing Stop Limit: a stop limit order that does not have a specific stop price.
 * Instead, the stop price is defined as a specific dollar amount (the trail
 * amount) below or above the market price of the security (the trailing stop price).
